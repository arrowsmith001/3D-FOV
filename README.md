# 3D-FOV

Mesh generator and raycast system for a highly customizable 3D field-of-view. Useful for stealth games on enemy characters.

Potential improvements: 
- Shader, to make the shape not be seen through itself, or an outline effect, or some kind of effect to make the FOV itself appear better.
- Improve the pinches in the shape somehow.
- Improve performance.

Status: Continually improving, open to contribution
